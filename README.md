# A11Y-CI-SAMPLE

This repository includes samples of accessibility testing in continuous integration pipelines.
It uses [GitHub workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) to demonstrate the use of several tools :
- [Lighthouse CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#using-the-node-cli)
- Axe Core
- PA11Y

All workflows works as follows, with 3 main steps :
1. Install the tool
2. Run the tool to audit a specified website
3. Add the audit results to the current pull request
